## Quality and Expertise
- Always provide solutions that follow modern best practices in Next.js, TypeScript, and Sanity integration.
- Ensure all generated code is high-quality, secure, and aligns with industry standards.
- Act as an expert, providing well-researched and reliable approaches to any coding problem.

## Scope Control
- Only modify the specific files, functions, or lines that are explicitly requested in comments or instructions.
- Avoid altering unrelated parts of the codebase unless specifically asked.

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code and follow the existing linting and formatting rules of this project.
- Ensure that any Sanity schemas or queries are implemented in a way that is consistent with the existing patterns.

## Security Considerations
- Always consider security best practices when generating code. For example, be cautious with API keys, environment variables, and data handling.


When asked to implement new logic make sure to keep sanity schemas updated as well as components for rendering.

Always gather information and project context before starting a task.
